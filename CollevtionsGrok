### Basic Level Questions on Java Collections

1. What is the Java Collections Framework? Explain its hierarchy.
2. What are the main interfaces in the Collections Framework? (e.g., List, Set, Map)
3. What is the difference between a Collection and Collections in Java?
4. Explain the difference between List and Set interfaces.
5. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
6. When would you use a HashSet over a TreeSet?
7. What is a Map interface? How does it differ from a Collection?
8. Explain the difference between HashMap and Hashtable.
9. What is an Iterator? How do you use it to traverse a Collection?
10. What is the purpose of the Comparable and Comparator interfaces in Collections?

### Intermediate Level Questions on Java Collections

1. How does HashMap internally store key-value pairs? Explain the hashing mechanism.
2. What happens when two different keys have the same hash code in a HashMap?
3. Explain the resizing process in ArrayList. What is its default initial capacity?
4. How does LinkedHashMap maintain insertion order?
5. What is the time complexity for common operations (get, add, remove) in ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and HashMap?
6. How can you make a Collection thread-safe? Give examples.
7. Explain fail-fast and fail-safe iterators with examples.
8. What is the difference between PriorityQueue and TreeSet?
9. How do you sort a List using Comparator?
10. What is the role of the equals() and hashCode() methods in Collections like HashSet and HashMap?

### Advanced Level Questions on Java Collections

1. Explain the internal implementation of ConcurrentHashMap. How does it achieve thread-safety without locking the entire map?
2. How would you implement a custom HashMap? Discuss handling collisions and resizing.
3. What are the differences between HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap in terms of ordering and performance?
4. Describe how TreeMap uses Red-Black Tree for its implementation.
5. Explain the concept of load factor in HashMap and its impact on performance.
6. How do you handle large datasets with Collections to avoid OutOfMemoryError? Discuss strategies like using streams or external sorting.
7. What is the difference between CopyOnWriteArrayList and synchronized ArrayList in a multi-threaded environment?
8. How can you create an immutable Collection in Java? Provide examples using Java 9+ features.
9. Discuss the use of Spliterator in Java 8+ for parallel processing of Collections.
10. Explain a scenario where you would use WeakHashMap over HashMap, and why.
